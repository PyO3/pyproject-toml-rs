## 0.13.0

## 0.11.0

* Update pep440_rs to 0.6.0
* Update pep508_rs to 0.6.0

## 0.8.0

* The `build_system` table is now optional. There are many projects that use pyproject.toml for tool configuration
  without specifying a build backend, which this change reflects.

## 0.6.0

* Update to latest [PEP 639](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639) draft. The `license` key is now an enum that can either
  be an SPDX identifier or the previous table form, which accepting PEP 639 would deprecate. The previous implementation
  of a `project.license-expression` key in `pyproject.toml` has
  been [removed](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/#define-a-new-top-level-license-expression-key).
